# Mental Health and Social Media Balance
A data-analysis project exploring the relationship between mental health and social media usage.

## Project Overview
This project aims to investigate how social media usage may correlate with mental health indicators. Using the dataset and code provided in the original work, the analysis covers:
* Descriptive statistics of users’ social media use and mental health survey responses.
* Exploration of potential associations between social media time/behaviour and mental-health outcomes.
* Visualisations and inference of whether a “balance” in social media usage might be related to better mental health.

## Motivation
Social media has become an integral part of everyday life. While it can provide connectivity, information, and support, there is growing concern about its impact on mental health (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression). This analysis is motivated by the need to better understand:
* How much social media usage is typical among respondents.
* Whether high or low usage relates to self-reported mental health measures.
* What “balance” in social media consumption might look like from a mental health perspective.

## Data & Methodology
* **Dataset**: The code uses data made available on the Kaggle platform under the project titled “Mental Health and Social Media Balance” by Ahmad Indra Giri.
* **Pre-processing**: The data is cleaned, missing values handled, and relevant variables selected (e.g., social media usage time, mental health survey responses).
* **Analysis**: Conducted using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and visualised with libraries such as Matplotlib/Seaborn. Key steps include
  * Summary statistics and distribution plots.
  * Correlation or association tests (e.g., between usage time and mental health scores).
  * Group comparisons (e.g., low vs high usage groups).
* **Findings**: The results are discussed, including what the data suggests (or doesn’t suggest) about social media balance and mental health.

## Key Visualisations
* Distribution of social media usage hours among respondents.
* Boxplots or violin plots of mental health scores by usage‐group category.
* Scatterplots and regression lines (if applicable) showing relationships between usage and mental health outcomes.
* Heatmap of correlation matrix.

## Take-aways & Insights
* The concept of “balance” is examined: simply less or more usage may not be the full story—context, type of usage, and individual differences matter.
* The analysis suggests [insert major result summary here: e.g., “moderate usage appears associated with better self-reported mental health compared to both very low and very high usage”] (you can refine this based on results).
* Limitations are noted: e.g., cross-sectional data cannot prove causation, survey responses are self-reported, potential confounders may exist.

## How to Use the Code
1. Clone or download the notebook from the Kaggle link.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`).
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```
3. Run the notebook step by step:
   * Load and inspect the dataset.
   * Clean the data and handle missing values.
   * Perform descriptive analysis and visualisation.
   * Conduct statistical tests or modelling, if included.
   * Interpret the results.
4. Feel free to extend the analysis by:
   * Adding more advanced modelling (e.g., regression, clustering).
   * Segmenting by demographic variables.
   * Exploring types of social media usage (active vs passive).
   * Incorporating temporal/duration data if available.

## Important Notes
* This study is **exploratory** and should not be taken as definitive evidence of causation.
* The dataset, like many survey/self-report datasets, may have biases.
* Ethical considerations around mental health data apply—respect privacy, anonymisation, and usage guidelines.

## Attribution
The original project notebook by Ahmad Indra Giri on Kaggle served as the foundation for this work. Please refer to that notebook for further detail, original visualisations, and any dataset licensing or usage terms.

## Next Steps
Possible extensions include:
* Expanding the dataset with longitudinal tracking of social media habits and mental health.
* Applying machine-learning models to predict mental health risk based on usage patterns.
* Qualitative research into *how* social media is being used (purpose, interaction type) and its psychological effects.
* Developing recommendations for “healthy balance” of social media use based on empirical findings.
